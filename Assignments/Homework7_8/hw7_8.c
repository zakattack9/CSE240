// CSE240 Fall 2019 HW 7 & 8
// Zak Sakata
// Write the compiler used: GCC

// READ BEFORE YOU START:
// You are given a partially completed program that creates a linked list of employee information.
// The global linked list 'list' is a list of employees with each node being struct 'employeeList'.
// 'employeeList' consists of struct 'employee' which has: employee name, room number, and a linked list of 'supervisors'.
// The linked list of supervisors has each node containing simply the name of the supervisor.
// HW7 ignores the 'supervisors' linked list since there is no operation/manipulation to be done on 'supervisors' list in HW7.
// HW8 has operations/manipulations to be done with 'supervisors' list like add a supervisor, display last added supervisor.

// To begin, you should trace through the given code and understand how it works.
// Please read the instructions above each required function and follow the directions carefully.
// If you modify any of the given code, the return types, or the parameters, you risk getting compile error.
// Yyou are not allowed to modify main ().
// You can use string library functions.

// ***** WRITE COMMENTS FOR IMPORANT STEPS OF YOUR CODE. *****
// ***** GIVE MEANINGFUL NAMES TO VARIABLES. *****
// ***** Before implementing any function, see how it is called in executeAction() *****
